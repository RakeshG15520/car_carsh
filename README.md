Background
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a directive requiring manufacturers and fleet operators to report certain crashes involving either advanced driver assistance or higher-level “automated driving systems.” The files describe each report and include information about the car, location, circumstances, and injury level.

Understanding the Differences: ADS vs Level 2 ADAS
Automated driving systems, still in development, encompass SAE Levels 3 through 5. In its mature state, a vehicle equipped with ADS aims to perform the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis within a defined operational design domain without driver involvement. While these vehicles are in development and are being tested on public roads in limited capacities, they are not available for consumer purchase at this time.

Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems provide both speed and steering input when the driver assistance system is engaged but require the human driver to remain fully engaged in the driving task at all times.
