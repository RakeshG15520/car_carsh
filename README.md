The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has issued a directive, mandating that manufacturers and fleet operators must report crashes that involve advanced driver assistance systems or higher-level automated driving systems. These reports will include details about the car, location, circumstances, and the level of injury sustained.

Automated driving systems, which are still being developed, are classified into SAE Levels 3 to 5. A vehicle equipped with an ADS aims to perform the entire driving task within a specific operational design domain without driver involvement. While these systems are being tested on public roads in limited capacities, they are not yet available for consumer purchase.

On the other hand, level 2 advanced driver assistance systems provide both speed and steering input, but the driver must remain fully engaged in the driving task at all times.

We have gathered real-time data and implemented metrics to measure the dead and injured person rates in both ADS cars and ADAS level 2 cars.
